                        It has  long been known that a diet<br/>
                        includes at least a few servings<br />
                        of fresh fruit every day will keep you<br />
                        healthy, fit and trim.<br />
                        Edit: That's not right. There is too much fructose<br />
                        in the fruits which is not like glucose and when<br />
                        the quantity is a little bit higher than normal,<br />
                        the body transforms the fructose in fats :)<br />
